# About
The pandemic sure did take a lot of our jobs and as college students, me and my friends need to pay for our tuition. Lets face it, the relief the government is providing is not enough and it will run out soon so its time to search for jobs, and quick.

The script webscrappes a craigslist link for current job offers in the area and creates a file retaining all the information relevant to each offer. Then it sends an email link containing an attachment of all the job listings to signed up users.

You can change the link to any craigslist link as long as it is in the jobs filter. Feel free to change the location and job type then use the new link in the code. You can also modify the code by adding if statements to only output certain results from the page based on your preferences.
